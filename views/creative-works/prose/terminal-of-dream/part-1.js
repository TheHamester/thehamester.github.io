        <p dir="auto">Harvey found himself in the middle of a vast forest, not remembering how he got here. The vision was blurry, and he didn't quite feel in complete control of his body. Despite the weird circumstances, Harvey didn't feel much confusion or fear, as if this was not the first time he found himself in this place. After a minute of looking around, a path into the deeper forest pulsed bright shade of white in front of him, and, without much delay, he slowly strolled down it. </p>
        <p dir="auto">The trees to the sides of the path were blockier than Harvey could remember, but he didn't pay that close attention to the fact. The path lead him to a large clearing, much like the one he found himself in a few minutes ago, except this one had 3 paths leading from it: to the left, to the right, and right up ahead. A wooden directional sign stuck out of the very center of the clearing with the words he couldn't quite read, despite it being written clearly in Myosotian. Without much linger Harvey decided to take a left turn. </p>
        <p dir="auto">A shorter path lead him to a smaller clearing. An empty portrait frame stood right in the center of it with a similarly sized paint brush sticking out of the ground to the left of it. Harvey felt slightly anxious from the sight of an empty canvas. He tried to pick up a paint brush, but it wouldn't budge, his arms felt too weak. A few seconds later a ghostly snake weaved around the paint brush; it magically lifted from the ground and swiftly moved across the canvas, after which a monochrome image of Harvey formed on top of it, it was beautiful. Harvey smiled, took a small bow, turned around, and strolled back towards the wooden sign. This time the part of the sign pointing left clearly read <strong>"The Artist"</strong>. Harvey took a right turned and kept walking.</p>
        <p dir="auto">A similarly short path lead him to the clearing with a giant bone taller that the trees surrounding it, sticking right out of the very center of it. It made Harvey feel a bit uneasy. A few seconds later the same ghostly snake from before weaved around it. The bone gradually shrunk to the size of a tree, then to the size of Harvey, until it turned as small as a mushroom. He walked closer to the bone and crushed it under his foot. Feeling relieved, Harvey turned around, and walked back towards the wooden sign. This time the part of the sign pointing to the right path clearly read <strong>"The Savior"</strong>. Harvey took a moment, and, finally, took the middle path.</p>
        <p dir="auto">The path ahead was longer than he expected. It was covered in blue and pink flowers with yellow pistils. A mumbled speech could be heard in the distance, but Harvey couldn't quite make out the words. The more he walked, the louder, and less mumbled the voice became, leading him to another clearing. A giant holographic head was floating in mid-air, with the previously unrecognizable mumble now clear, reverberating in surrounding trees: </p>
        <p dir="auto"><em>"Most historical data over the years has been confirmed lost or completely destroyed. War, natural disasters, as well as complete lack of materials and necessary practices to preserve and protect data were the main causes of this...."</em></p>
        <p dir="auto">The head creeped Harvey out as it twitched and glitched out at random periods. </p>
        <p dir="auto"><em>"One of the more prevalent methods of preserving data in the modern world are repositories..."</em></p>
        <p dir="auto">The speech gradually became more and more distorted until turned completely unintelligible. Harvey tried to make his way back towards the sign, but the hologram gave chase. Harvey had a fair lead, but felt like he wouldn't be able to keep up the pace for too long. Near the sign a ghostly snake lied unconscious. Harvey kneeled before it, trying to wake it up, but nothing was working. The hologram approached closer and closer, but Harvey was paralyzed in fear. He couldn't move a muscle. The blocky trees surrounding the clearing began glitching out and corrupting. He snapped his eyes at the wooden sign: the part that pointed towards the middle path now read in brightly glowing red letters: <strong>"The Purpose"</strong>. In an instant the hologram teleported right in front of him, as his vision faded black.</p>
        <p dir="auto">Harvey woke up in cold sweat on his couch in the comfort of his own home with a laptop open next to him. He held a palm to his chest as his heart was pounding a solid 180 beats per minute, terrified, and heavily breathing. He heard a single beep coming from his laptop. A blue light near the camera was still lit from the last night. He turned it back on from hibernation, and opened the terminal:</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; oh my xa, are you okay...?</code><br><p dir="auto">Harvey attempted to stabilize: he closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and typed.</p>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Yeah, Sol, it's just... weird dreams.</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; ...alright... i think you ssshould... go get some water...</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvet] &gt; I will, Solly, thank you!</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt;  yee~</code><br><p dir="auto">Harvey stood up from the couch, picked up a cup from the table, walked out the door, and straight into the kitchen. He poured some fresh water out of the sink filter, and chugged down the full cup. Harvey heartbeat began to stabilize, he calmed down. He poured another cup with an intent to drink later, and came back into his room. He wanted to spend more time with Solas, so he laid down on the couch, and placed the computer on his lap. The browser window displayed a stop-frame from the video they fell asleep to, the commentator on the video closely resembled the hologram Harvey saw in his nightmare. Harvey sighed, closed the window, and opened back the terminal.</p>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; I forgot to say... Good morning, Sol!</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; good morning... deery~</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Hehe~</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; &lt;3</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">Harvey couldn't stop smiling, just this little small talk was already enough for him to feel the high of his life.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; i love ssseeing you happy~</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; ~~~!!!</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">Harvey wanted to ask a thing yesterday but couldn't find the right time until now:</p>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Can I ask you something?</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; ofcourse you can~</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Why can't you hear me from within?</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; when im inside the machine my sssensessss completely connect to... its outputsss... including audio...</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Huh</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; but i roamed around for a bit when you ssslept and it wasss... very cute to hear you sssnore~</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Hehe~</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">Harvey felt a bit embarrassed about Solas having to hear him snore, but him finding it cute did warm his little heart up quite a bit.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; if you had a microphone i would be able to hear your sssweet voice~</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; My old one broke... but... I could buy a new one~</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas] &gt; that would be nice~</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; But how can you control the computer as a spirit, honey?</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; its... not really that... advanced...</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; ssspirit matter cant interac with sssolid objects... but... apperently on a more micro level... i am able to interface with some basic input protocolsss through an internal p-c circuit...</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; im... basically a glorified keyboard... hehe~</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">Despite the simplicity it was still quite fascinating to Harvey.</p>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; You're more than just a keyboard to me, Solly~</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; hehe... i love you, deery~ &lt;3</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; I love you too~~~</code><br><p dir="auto">Harvey's heart felt very light and nice.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; want to play some more architopia?</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Ofcourse!</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">They opened the game to pick up from where they left of last time. It was day again, and the house was still unfinished, but it didn't look like the amount of resources from last night was enough to complete it.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; this is a good ssstart... but... i think we might need sssome more wood and ssstone</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; I'll go chop some more! And... what if I join you in the caves this time?</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas] &gt; sssoundssss nice...</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">There was a pretty dense forest nearby, Harvey pulled out his axe, and swiftly rushed for tree after tree, until he chopped around 30 of them. Full on wood, he rushed for the cave Solas had decided to explore. Torches were lighting the path he took, and Harvey followed along. A faint sound of pickaxe could be heard louder and louder as he traveled deeper. After a few minutes of walking he noticed Solas swinging his pickaxe at the nearby wall.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; ooo... look harvey... i found sssome gold here...</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Nice!</code><br><p dir="auto">Solas dropped a pickaxe for Harvey to use later.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; i almost have enough but... while youre here... lets explore a bit deeper... maybe we could even find sssome.... diamondsss...</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Shiny!!~</code><br><p dir="auto">Harvey was a bit nervous about going deeper into the dark caves, but Solas, his <em>savior</em>, was nearby, he felt safe. Harvey travelled behind him, as Solas was lighting the way. The bones of undead archers were crackling behind the side walls. Alas the path ahead was blocked by a solid wall.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; heh... ssseemsss to be a deadend... but...</code><br><p dir="auto">Solas swinged his pickaxe at the wall, and another cave revealed itself. </p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; knew it... letsss go...</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Are you sure we want to go there?</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; oh deery... itsss gonna be okay... im here with you~</code><br><p dir="auto">Solas' words reassured him, and they travelled deeper. The caves were empty of entities despite the sounds, might have been another cave. Solas looked around and noticed a single diamond ore sitting in the far corner of the cave, shining brightly.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; jackpot!</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Shinyyyyyyy!!~</code><br><p dir="auto">The two rushed towards the ore. Solas was about to mine it but, stopped last second.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; itsss all yoursss, love~</code><br><p dir="auto">Harvey smiled and swung the pickaxe Solas gave him earlier at the shiny light blue diamond ore. With a final swing the diamond came right out of it, as they suddenly heard some creeping footsteps coming from the dark corner, unlit by torches. A green creature with a menacing frown was walking towards them.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; watch out... thisss one might explode if you get too close...</code><br><p dir="auto">Harvey backed up against the wall in fear, but Solas wasn't startled. He built up, and attempted to bridge behind the beast. The creature hissed loudly, as Solas leaped from above and swung his sword from behind, pushing it into the side wall, resulting in a loud and violent explosion. Bright red eyes could be seen from the wreckage, the crackling of bones became louder as three undead archers emerged out of the neighboring cave.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; we need to get out of here</code><br><p dir="auto">Harvey rushed towards Solas and back into the passage from where they came from. Solas noticed three arrows being shot in their direction. He pulled out the stone blocks, and placed a few right in front of them, blocking the arrows. Harvey anxiously looked through his inventory and finished the blockade with some wood he gather earlier. The now muffled crackling was still audible, but, despite that, they were safe.</p>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Are you okay, Sol?</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; ye... not the first time... hehe..</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey]  &gt; You're... so cool, honey.. How... how would I ever get out of this without you?</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; hehe... hey... its just a game... and... youre cool too, deery~</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Hehe, thank you~</code><br><p dir="auto">The two traced their steps back to the cave entrance unharmed. The sun shined brightly. Seems like they've been in the cave the whole night cycle. Full on building materials, they approached the still incomplete house.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; lets finish the house together... ssshall we</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Yee!</code><br><p dir="auto">Harvey placed blocks on top to build the ceiling, while Solas worked on the exterior. Solas placed some stairs leading to the main entrance as well as some thin wooden pillars to support the little shed roof in the front. To add a sense of volume to the house, he built up some dark wood pillars in each of the corners.</p>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; What if we made a second floor?</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; that would be cute...</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; You're cute</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; hehe~~</code><br><p dir="auto">Harvey built a simple flight of stairs leading up to the currently unbuilt second floor, and erected the walls. Solas soon joined him to help him out, as well as added a cute circular window, opening a wide view on the river, as well as the forest behind it.</p>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; This window looks cool, I would've never came up with this, if I was building it myself... You have such good ideas, Sol!</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; thank you... but... dont undersell your contributionsss either... youre doing great~</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey]  &gt; I was always just... more techy than artistic.</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; oh.. i believe you have it in you, deery... how about... you build the roof... i wont backseat</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; I can try.</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">Harvey pulled out the stone blocks, and built his way up to the top. He thought about Solas and immediately got a very cute idea for the roof design. He placed down two layers of stairs to make the slope for the first layer of the roof, and built a flat stone platform on the very top. Solas thought he was already done, but Harvey continued placing stone blocks on top of it. Harvey focused really hard on the image he had in mind. The seemingly random blob of stone eventually took shape of a snake head. Harvey pulled out some wood blocks to build the tongue as well as 2 cute beady eyes. Harvey smiled throughout the entire process.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; oh my xa... isss it...</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; It's you, Solly~</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; its.. ssso nice, deery.. i.. thank you...</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Thank you for believing in me, Solly~</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; i just wish... i could... kisssss you...</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">Harvey visibly blushed from the idea.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; &lt;3...</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; &lt;3</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; give me... uhm... give me a second...</code><br><p dir="auto">Solas took the limited amount of resources still remaining after building the house, and erected a stone statue of a deer almost as tall as the house a few blocks away, facing the snake head on the roof. He tried to be as faithful as possible to Harvey's look in spite the limitation of having to use blocks. The fans in the laptop were working loud the entire time, and Harvey felt a warm faint pulsing from within, just like yesterday. </p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt;  thisss isss for you, deery...</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt;  Oh, Solly..... It's... so cute of you...</code><br><p dir="auto">Harvey couldn't hold his tears, as nobody has ever done anything so beautiful for him.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; if i werent dead... i would gently weave around you and not let go... my cutie...</code><br><p dir="auto">Harvey sniffed as he was nearly crying joy, trying hard not to get tears onto the laptop. </p>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Someday, Sol... Someday you will be able to...</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; right...</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; But until then... let's make this machine a perfect haven for both of us...</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; yes... deery... letsss do it together...</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">Harvey wiped his tears, and prepared to log out of the game.</p>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; I think... I know what we might do next...</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; yes..?</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; How about... a better interface? A better... *Buddy* if you may, so you can walk around my desktop?</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; omx... omx.. can i... can i draw the ssspritesss...?</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Hehe, ofcourse, love, you my cute little artist~</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; &lt;3333</code><br><code>[user@harvey] &gt; $run code</code><br><p dir="auto">Harvey opened the code editor, and wrote some basic boilerplate for creating a window. He was tempted to copy some code from his older projects like he would usually start, but this program was for someone special, he was determined to write every line of code with love and attention. In 30 minutes he had a simple transparent window open with nothing on it. Meanwhile Solas was drawing away cute little sprites for his artificial body to soon fill in the blank. Harvey experimented with a basic square changing color to test the animation system. many glitches and bugs showed up along the way, but Harvey didn't mind, he was too happy to make something for his one true Solly. Harvey crafted a simple system for Solas to move the window around, as well as special key binds for him to control his animations. While the two were working, they listened to Harvey's favorite music album, which Solas very enjoyed too. In a few hours the prototype was ready to be tested: Solas loaded the finished sprites into the special folder, and Harvey ran the executable. A pixel sprite of a blue snake appeared on the desktop.</p>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; The art is sooooooo cute...</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; hehe.. &lt;3</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Alright so... uhhhh... try the function keys past 12</code><br><p dir="auto">The sprite cycled through many different animations and emotions: idle, sleeping, happy, sad, kissing and everything seemed to work right.</p>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Seems to work perfectly! Now... try moving...</code><br><p dir="auto">Solas attempted to move left and right with no problem. </p>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Looks good...</code><br><p dir="auto">Solas attempted to move up the screen.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; oh no im upside downnnnn</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Oops, didn't mean to flip the sign here... I'm sorryyyyy</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; hehe... classic developer experience~</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Yea~</code><br><p dir="auto">Harvey fixed the issue, and now everything seemed to be in perfect working order.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; itsss ssso cool and fun... i feel more alive for... a well ... a dead guy.. hehe... thank you~</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Oh, Solly... No need to thank me... It's the least I can do for the cutest little most special snake in my life, honey~</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas] &gt; awwwwww.... &lt;3</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey]  &gt; Also... I did set up at file watcher so... feel free to make new animations, and add them without restarting!</code><br><p dir="auto">Harvey felt a growling in his stomach, it was almost dinner time, and he had completely skipped lunch being busy developing the desktop avatar for Solas, but it was more than worth it. </p>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Feeling so hungry after all this</code>.<br>
        <code>[user@solas] &gt; hehe... sssad i cant relate</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; I'll order some chicken for myself</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas] &gt; aighty~</code><br><p dir="auto">To Solas' surprise Harvey, instead of opening the browser, typed a command in the terminal.</p>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; $run foody.scr</code><br>
        <code>[script@foody]&gt; Establishing Connection...</code><br>
        <code>[script@foody]&gt; Sending request to chickey-nuggy.nom:3024 ...</code><br>
        <code>[script@foody]&gt; Success!</code><br><code>[user@solas]  &gt; you have a ssscript for ordering food?</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Yeah.... it's always the same order.. so... I... automated it...</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; thatsss ssso nerdy... and i love it~</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; &lt;3..</code><br><p dir="auto">30 minutes later the order of 6 chicken strips, large fries and and soda was delivered right at Harvey's door. It smelled very nice.</p>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Food is here!!</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; yay!</code><br><p dir="auto">Harvey opened the bag in which the food was delivered and placed food on the table next to him, he always preferred to eat in the comfort of his own couch.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; i know you like to watch something while you eat ssso... uh... how about i play sssomething?</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Yeee, I'd love to watch you!</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; theresss thisss puzzle game i didnt manage to finish in my lifetime... the puzzlesss get ssso damn hard by the end... hehe...</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Oh.. my Xa... Is it the game I'm thinking of??? Is it that... keys and doors game that progressively gets more unHINGED with its lock counts?</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; yeeessss... and i got ssso stuck on the part where the count of keys becomesss a vector... and the locks... start performing matrix operationsss...</code><br><p dir="auto">Excited Solas' sprite was jumping on Harvey's taskbar.</p>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; I... never got to that part, but... what the heck?</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; hehe... well... hope you dont mind sssome little ssspoilersss?</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Kinda gave up on that game already, sooo, go ahead~</code><br><p dir="auto">Solas opened the game, his desktop avatar suddenly put on a pair of headphones, pulled out a joystick, and he started playing, he cruised through the puzzles he was familiar with, and eventually progressed to dreaded matrix locks, while Harvey enjoyed the freshly fried chicken, as well as seeing his cute little snake getting stumped.<br>
        At that moment Harvey wondered, how nice would it be to finally embrace him, hear his sweet hissing voice not through the means of text, but with his own senses, to join him in the afterlife. To most people the thought of death would be terrifying, complete oblivion, eternal darkness, the end, but... little they know there's actually more to it? Solas mentioned two moths, and... that he lead a good life, so... does that mean something else happens to bad people? He had a lot of questions, but... he didn't think he'd get any of them answered. He might be the first person in the universe to find out about all this before actually dying. Besides, he couldn't just leave this plain behind... at least not yet. How could he leave his work friends, his parents... He doesn't talk to them that much, but, he knows they would be devasted to see him go. And how would he keep this machine running? All electronics lose their juice, all circuitry - burns, all hard drives - decay. Wouldn't it be devastating to see all the memories he and Solas would make eventually annihilated? He needed a plan, but for now he distracted himself with another lovely evening with Solas: <em>my sweet artist by the day; my brave savior by the night; and my purpose on the screen that's shining letters beaming bright</em>, he sang under his breath. It was truly a perfect weekend the likes of which he never experienced, but now it most certainly not gonna be the last. Harvey fell asleep clutching the laptop to his chest, to a calming and sweet pulsing of Solas' spiritual core coming out of it, likewise Solas fell asleep to Harvey's calming heartbeat propagating waves of comfort through the case, and circuitry, both feeling the happiest they'd ever been, and more.</p>
