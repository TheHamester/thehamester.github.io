        <p dir="auto">It was a usual Friday evening, a door into the house slowly opened, bleeding the vibrant red light of the setting sun into the corridor right onto the clothes hanger. It had been a long day after work, Harvey came in sweaty and exhausted. He had to run not to miss a bus back home that almost left without him. He closed the door, and, after a bit of lingering, he took off his coat, and put it on the said hanger. He entered the bathroom to the left of the entrance, washed his hooves and face with cold water - it felt refreshing. </p>
        <p dir="auto">He was slightly hungry, so he entered the kitchen right up ahead, grabbed a bag of chips from the upper drawer, poured fresh cold water into his favorite cup. He is not a big fan of cooking, and  would often resort to fast food, yet he seemed to never had gained weight from it and remained in a fairly good shape, most likely because of very frequent rushes he would end up in due to going to and from work. </p>
        <p dir="auto">With a bag of chips and a cup he entered his room with a couch in the right corner and a small desk standing against it. On top of the desk lied a small laptop, it was a fairly old model, but it was enough for most after work activities Harvey would do: he liked listening to music; watching nerdy content on the web; and playing small games, mostly single player experiences, since he would often find big multiplayer titles to be overwhelming and stressful. He placed a bag of chips and the cup on the desk, sat down on the couch with the pillow couching his back against the wall, put the computer on his lap and opened it. He opened the terminal window, and typed in:</p>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; $run flame</code><br> </p>
        <p dir="auto">A browser window opened up, after which he minimized the terminal into his taskbar. He clicked on the "V-Hub" link in his bookmarks, and started scrolling through recommendations to find a suitable video. It would often take a while for him to find the right video to relax, or eat to. After a while he stumbled into a video essay on the history of operating systems, and clicked on it. His nerdy heart was always interested in computers, and how they operate: in all the 0s, 1s and 2s that go into making them work, and in complex webs of Pyro-Cryo (P-C) circuitry that revolutionized modern technology to make them possible.</p>
        <p dir="auto">After finally finding a perfect video he opened a bag of chips, and made himself comfortable. Computer on his lap began working a bit warmer than it usually would, but Harvey found it rather pleasant, a kind of warmth one would feel when a cat would fall asleep on your lap.</p>
        <p dir="auto">It was 10 minutes into the video when Harvey noticed an orange pulsing coming from the terminal icon in his task bar. He maximized the terminal window and saw a log message under the command he typed to open the browser: </p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; oh... i loved watching that guy</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">Harvey was confused, he didn't remember connecting to any chat room, yet that wouldn't explain how the person texting could've known what he was watching. He typed back into his terminal:</p>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; He's indeed great, however, who are you, and how can you see that?</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">The mysterious user replied in a few seconds:</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; my name is sssolas, and don't worry... i'm not a hacker or anything... i'm sssimply... an observer</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">Harvey was a bit anxious about what was going on, but something told him Solas wasn't lying, and he curiously asked:</p>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; An observer, what do you mean by that?</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; i'm just a ssspirit... travelling aimlessly around the universe...</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">Harvey never heard about spirits, or what comes after death, other than a few ancient texts that he would be given to review back in school, but history was never his strong suit.</p>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; So you're not alive?</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas] &gt; not in the sssame way you are... you sssee... after my death I was faced in front of a council of two moths... they said i lead a good life ssso... they let me into thisss... afterlife... to explore the universe freely as a bodyless ssspirit...</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Are there others like you?</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; there are countlesss ssspiritual coloniesss throughout the universe... yet for me... it sssstill feels a bit lonely... making friends is difficult... it all sssounds crazy but... i couldn't make this up if i wanted to...</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Well, it sure does, but I believe you.</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">Harvey sighed, and, after a brief pause, he typed:</p>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Would you like to watch the rest of the video together?</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; that... sssounds great!!!</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">As the last message appeared, the laptop felt much warmer than before, but it still fairly comforting. It was an hour long essay, during which Harvey had finished the entire bag of chips. Throughout the video Solas made a lot of silly comments which would get an occasional chuckle out of Harvey. The two started to get along pretty quickly. Solas felt like a close friend to share his interests with that he never had. As Harvey was thinking that, Solas interrupted with a sudden message:</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; we can be friends... right?</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">Without a smidge of doubt Harvey replies:</p>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; 'Course we can... I don't think I've ever met anyone who's into nerdy stuff as much as I am.</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; i'm... ssso happy to hear that... i...</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">The laptop's cooler started to spin at very high speed, then toned down a few seconds later.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; i'm sssorry about that... i've just... never had a true friend...</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; It's okay, you're... such a cool guy!</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; you too~</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">This little interaction made his little heart feel very nice, a type of happiness he never experienced before, something inside of him really wanted to hug the laptop, but he restrained... for now.</p>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Hey, we could play a coop game, I have one lying around I got off a work collegue. She didn't need it anymore. Something called "Architopia"? I think it's a sandbox? I never opened it, honestly.</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; oh... i know that one... you break blocksss... craft... build a house to sssurvive the night... and it gives you ssso much creative freedom... i'm down!</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">Harvey opened the case in which resided the game's disc, pulled it out, and inserted it into the drive. After a few minutes of loading, a window appeared with an option to create a new world. Harvey asked Solas:</p>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; What should we name it, Sol?</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; hehe... i'm thinking... "harveyster's solastice"</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Ha, that's cute, it's like our names... Guess, we'll do a lot of farming then!</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; hehe... you bet</code><br></p>
        <p dir="auto">Harvey loaded into the world, and opened it for local connection. Solas typed:</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; run architopia</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">A second game window opened, and immediately minimized itself. The computer fans started to go faster due to increased processing unit load.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; i hope it won't crash on us... hehe</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; It's been through worse</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">Solas has connected into the game, he had an avatar that resembled a cyan snake with white lines all throughout his body.</p>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; You've got a pretty cute character here</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; thank you~ i made it after my own look... hehe</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Too bad I don't have my own avatar, just some default Joe</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; oh... give me a second~</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; $run brush</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; $run cam</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">A camera LED above the screen glowed blue, and a window of a graphical editor flashed on the screen for a split second before closing.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; $copy harvey.img .\architopia\avatars\Harvey\</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; take a look at yourself now... uh... open your inventory</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">Harvey opened his inventory and saw pixelated avatar of a brown deer, with red circles around his eyes, reddish-brown antlers, and green eyes. It was like a carbon copy of his own image stylized in blocky art style.</p>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; awwww... It looks so cute! You're an artist, Sol</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; thank you... i tried my best... and... you are just... naturally cute~</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">Harvey visually blushed.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; the camera is still on by the way~</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; L-let's just play the game</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; hehe~</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">The two walked started to walk around their starting area.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; so... since you've never played this... we need to find some trees and punch the HELL out of them to get wood!</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Fair enough</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">Harvey ran to the nearest tree he could find and kept clicking on it, the block didn't seem to budge.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; you gotta hold down the button... silly</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; I'm learningggg</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; hehe... dw</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">Harvey held down the button and the block eventually broke and entered his inventory. Solas then approached closer, and helped with breaking the rest of the tree. Harvey smiled throughout this whole moment, even the idea of being helped with the most trivial task felt extremely comforting to him.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; awesome... now that we have wood we can make some TOOLS</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Yay.. And... thank you for the help</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; heh... you're welcome~</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">Solas crafted a basic pickaxe, a sword, and an axe, and also a copy of each for Harvey.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; this should do for now, we're gonna build a house together... but first... you should get some more wood... and immma mine some stone... sounds good?</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Yay, be careful out there!</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; hehe.. dw... i'll be fine~</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">After a few minutes of resource gathering they both met at the starting location, which was a perfect surface to build their first house on. The sun was close to setting.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; looks like a good place...</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Yee</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">Solas placed the stone foundation, and Harvey placed wood blocks on top of them, leaving a small hole in the middle for the door, but by the time they could get to building the second layer the sun was already below the horizon. A lone undead archer was creeping in the distance.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; so far so goo... MOVE!</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">Solas pushed Harvey out of the way of the arrow flying in his direction. Realizing the danger were in, Harvey jumped behind half finished wall, and stayed low, while trying to quickly finish building it.</p>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Quick, get behind cover, Sol!</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">Harvey peaked from out the small window he left in the wall, but Solas was nowhere to be seen. He was scared that the archer might have gotten him. A few seconds later Harvey heard a faint sound of clanking bones followed by a blunt thump. Harvey's heart was racing. After a few seconds  something suddenly tapped him from behind.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; boo!</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">Harvey quickly turned around, and Solas was standing right there, wearing a skeleton head.</p>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Phew, it's you...</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; sorry... i didn't mean to scare you... but... i got that clanky son of a bitch...</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Heh... you're fine, and... thank you... again</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">They took a brief pause.</p>
        <code>[user@harvey]  &gt; You know, even though I know it's just a game, but... all this did get my heart beating, don't remember that happening before!</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; oh maybe i know just the reason why~</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; What do you mean?</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; well... when i called you cute earlier you turned red like a tomato... hehe... ssso...</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">Harvey gulped.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; you're very sssweet... you know? and... i..</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; i think...</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">It was a fairly long pause, and Harvey's heartbeat sped up from the suspense of what Solas was about to say.</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; ...i love you... harvey</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">The message struck him like a shot of pure endorphins, and Harvey couldn't hold himself any longer: he clutched his laptop tightly to his chest. Solas could feel Harvey's heart beating super fast from within the machine. Comforting warmth radiated from the processing unit and spreading throughout Harvey's chest. Harvey could also feel a faint pulsing from within the laptop itself, as if it was Solas' beating heart, going faster and faster. Harvey was beyond euphoric, it felt like the happiest moment in his entire life, just as it was Solas'. Harvey stayed like this for a few more minutes before letting go, and typing in to the terminal as fast as possible:</p>
        <code>[user@harvey]  &gt; I love you too, Sol...</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; i... i could feel it... i... could feel your heart... it wasss... beautiful...</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey]  &gt; I could feel yours too~</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; ...it was ssso.... nice... i... could i... again... uh...</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">Before he could finish the sentence Harvey hugged the laptop again. the laptop's fans started to work much louder, and the pulsing from within was even stronger than before, as was Harvey's heart. The two were now beating in sync with one another, and the resonating beating enhanced their euphoric feelings even more. A few minutes later a message appeared on screen:</p>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; ...could i call you... deery??</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; 'Course you can, silly... or... how about Solly?</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; heh... yeeee, my deery...</code><br>
        <code>[user@hearvey] &gt; My silly snek~ How about we... continue Architopia tomorrow... and... we watch some... MORE NERDY VIDEOS before bed</code><br>
        <code>[user@solas]  &gt; you know the way to your sssilly sssnek's heart... don't you... deary~</code><br>
        <code>[user@harvey] &gt; Guess I do, Sol... Guess I do...</code><br>
        <p dir="auto">And so they spent the rest of their evening happily watching nerdy essays and memes, feeling safe and happy in each other's presence, and eventually falling asleep to a random video about modern data preservation methods.</p>
