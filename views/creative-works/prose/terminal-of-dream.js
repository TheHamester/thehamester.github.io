        Terminal of Dream is a gay love story about a deer named Harvey and a spirit snake named Solas.  
        Solas possessed Harvey's laptop, after which the two quickly became very close and fell in love. 
        It's a story of true companionship at the seams between life and death, and a strife to keep those memories and a haven that stores them alive forever.
