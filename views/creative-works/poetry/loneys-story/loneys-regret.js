        Dear diary, hi, it's old friend Loney,
        Today, surprise, surprise, was lonely,
        And you might ask what was the cause,
        The reason, wellâ€¦ that's how it goes:

        'Tis felt like not a big surprise,
        To think I'd fail to keep their eyes
        On my existence, interest dies,
        Thought all I heard was painful lies

        About how fun and nice I was
        When I'm around, though how it goes:
        I paint myself with violent words
        Deserved to hear from mouths of yours.

        I felt not worth the exhibition,
        To fix it, I went on a mission:
        My feelings better in suppression -
        Hide myself, and my depression.

        A later week, it felt like mist,
        The signals, messages, they ceased,
        In spite of countless praises list,
        Believed I simply wasn't missed.

        And that was why I flew to space,
        Away from fallacies, away from falsely grace,
        I stopped believing without trace
        Of doubting what my head proclaims.

        An honest truth, I have regrets,
        I should've maybe listened to my friends,
        Antenna spoke too loud on loop,
        It didn't know me; I was just its troop;

        Merely a slave to void's call,
        That'd lead me to a violent fall
        Right off the face of godly earth,
        Away from friendly loving turf...

        And now I'm here flying alone;
        In hope I find my way back home;
        I plead forgiveness I was gone
        For I was just antenna's pawn...
    </p>
