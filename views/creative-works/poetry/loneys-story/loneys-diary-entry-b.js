        So here I am: no boar, no lamb,
        No bear, no lion, and no ram
        Cat jumping on the writing train
        To bless you with my rhymes again.

        Whoever reads this journal once
        In future at the end of our dance
        Whoever someday reads this page
        Wish you a pleasant, lovely, day enhanced.

        Despite the little cage In which 
        You locked yourself away for months
        Like your old me away from glitched
        Mixed signals snitching at my buds.
        
        They slowly get to me Albeit,
        Mostly gargled mess of nuts
        And crazy theories of faith in
        How their honest words are lies alas.

        Do I succumb to what is likely
        Just antenna's static gust
        Of wind to overthrow me mightily
        Losing my own sense of trust?

        The answer switching back and forth:
        Like game of tug of war my mind,
        Is playing more than it is worth…
        But what if they leave me behind?…

        Left with myself, antenna's lots
        Of hateful comments to my name;
        It hates my guts, streaming me thoughts
        Away from them I can't contain.

        Maybe I'm crazy, and they know
        The 'truth' will throw me off my way,
        Into the pit of lost, not found
        Forever lone, and locked away?
