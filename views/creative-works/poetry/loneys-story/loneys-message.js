        Does anyone copy,
        Is anyone there?
        It's message from Loney,
        Please answer my prayer…

        Been floating for years,
        In the darkness of space,
        Collecting my tears
        Looking out for a place…

        …A place I called home,
        Will they even remember
        Weird alien gone
        Without trace in September?

        Weird alien known
        For antenna in hair?
        Weird alien lone
        Who's obsessed to be cared?

        When silence is louder,
        It hurts as bites plenty,
        For heart to empower
        My feelings of empty.

        I'm stuck in the vacuum
        Where no sound can leak,
        Of infinite volume,
        Unable to speak…

        …Unable to speak
        For my mind to be tame,
        Unable to seek
        For one's help without shame.

        Does anyone copy?
        Whoever can trace,
        Please join me in void 
        Of the audible space.
    </p>
