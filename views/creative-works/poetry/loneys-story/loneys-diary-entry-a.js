        Feeling undead:
        Some rainy day, antenna's prey;
        Feeding me grey extended play
        Of static, signaling unstructured
        Information's fragment fractured

        No hint, no hand:
        Emotion - sad, unlabeled, bad;
        Laying in bed, by nonsense led;
        In pencil's lead, trying to get
        The reason â€˜hind me going mad.

        No time well spent:
        A wasted week before the end
        Until it's time for labor's land
        To give me iron bars to bend
        Through mess unflushed, unsound, unfed.

        Unfinished thread:
        Going in loops from poles to hoops,
        Explaining horrid bleeps and bloops
        An acrobatic trickster doomed
        Had better luck shooting the moon.
