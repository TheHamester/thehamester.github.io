        At once there were mere time and space,
        Of single element devoid,
        So Xa the 'lotl 'seer took pace
        For process, one to cease the void.

        Their gills have shined across and spanned
        The horizontal of the sea,
        Inscribed on them all that was spent,
        All that is now, and that will be.

        The sea of space - a canvas empty,
        The serpent Oth to shape the state,
        So they created portions plenty
        Of elements of which were eight.

        They rushed, they crashed, for bonds to form,
        New matter different types to call,
        So eight almighty gods were born
        For ensued chaos to control.

        Hamester fox of raging fire,
        The blood runs hot through his young heart,
        His fur withstands the heat much higher
        Than anyone could ever chart.

        His brother Frysen, one of Ice,
        The fox of zero absolute,
        No cold against him would suffice
        From head, to heart, to mighty foot.

        The geo vulture Zemothel
        The group's protective shield,
        The solid earth he handles well,
        So he would never yield.

        Majestic owl Voz, he wields
        The gaseous state with ease;
        Brings order to the airfields,
        And universe to peace.

        Hyra shark, of water 'seer
        She's liquids' master of the team,
        In any foe inducing fear
        With power of the hydro stream.

        But Paraoh on the other side,
        She holds the Vapor's name;
        Can phase through any hole in sight
        Mobility is young shark's game.

        Mother Phaenah, moth of nature,
        Giving life, and healing mind,
        In her design is any creature
        That anyone could ever find.

        At last the old moth Tamuth shows:
        Where there's life, there will be death,
        She's here to guide the poor old souls,
        When creature draws its final breath.

        In the center of the world,
        They orbit around Xa like phantoms,
        The overseers, the gods of all,
        The Nucleus of Libra Elementum.
