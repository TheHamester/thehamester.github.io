        Time to break character, Azzy's the name,
        Some artist and poet ensnared in self blame;
        A small introduction to scribbles and sounds,
        I'm drawing and writing away in my grounds.

        My pictures of world that I crave to create,
        An element haven for stories to land;
        Occasional character sculpted by dreams,
        That my neural tissue in sleeping realm streams.

        My poetry written in red ink ingrained,
        Creating my art out of voices untamed:
        Hidden behind a lone cat all in pain,
        Hidden behind a brave fox with no name.

        And that's the two main sides of your dear old me,
        Like day and night contrast of what's plain to see:
        A mess overthinking the heck to no sense,
        A reason and comforting voice to my friends;
        With colorful animals bounded in paints,
        I'm glad I can share passion's craft of my brains.
    </p>
