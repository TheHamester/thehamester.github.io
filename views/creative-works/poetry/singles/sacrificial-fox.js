        And just as I foreseen,
        A three way tie of knots,
        We failed the test of trust unseen,
        In hindsight clear like newborn's thoughts

        And yet it's not our faults,
        The truth hidden like precious rocks,
        On beach behind hundreds of locks,
        Yet I'm no key-smith, just a simple fox

        No action took was our best move,
        In game of where our trust was all,
        The more it broke, became less smooth
        Our path to leave, now most might fall.

        All I could do was make a choice,
        You over me, me over you, It seemed, 
        It's how it flows.
        I can't save everyone, Too late, 
        So hear my voice,
        To leave or not the call is yours

        For maybe everything not lost,
        A three way tie intense on all the fronts,
        Could all the nodes keep it indoors,
        And wait, for everybody not to lose?
        Who knows?
