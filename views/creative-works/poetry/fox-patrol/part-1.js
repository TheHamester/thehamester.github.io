        A dear young cat,
        Among the ones who fox looks over;
        A tired pant,
        To see they need a helping shoulder,

        Who's in dismay,
        All lonely, yet the fox will never sleep;
        He's here to play,
        To talk, to hug, to joke, to love, to help, to keep.

        To keep you safe,
        He feels your pain at times like own;
        He's always here, have faith,
        He saw, he felt a lot, he's grown.

        The fox won't seize
        The post of love, nor stop to fight,
        For those who's yet to find lost keys,
        For those whose path in need of light.
    </p>
