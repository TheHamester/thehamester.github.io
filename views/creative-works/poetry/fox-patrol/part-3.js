        A toad of red in rusty armor
        Entrapped for longest year remained,
        In work of boring his commander,
        No rest, you serve until you faint.

        Ensnared in labour of this kind,
        Yet nobody could take away,
        The only freedom that of mind,
        He brainstormed til' the final day;

        The day of warmth in spite of cold,
        Released to play, and to create,
        To hug the ones he missed tenfold,
        Now's time to spend, not time to wait.

        A craft of rusty sword forgotten,
        The lock along with it was molten,
        The craft of mind is to embrace,
        And creativity to chase.
