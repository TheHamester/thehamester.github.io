        At once a creature their protector outgrew,
        A tiny axolotl turned to moth and flew;
        Her key's been found, the lock's no more,
        She's to discover her new lore.

        Tis' not the last the fox has seen of moth,
        She'd come around some time to show her worth;
        In figure eights, and figure Os,
        In figure dragons, bunnies, sharks, and crows,

        She'd fly around leaving a trace,
        Of many different colors' grace,
        In shapes of critters filling space,
        She found her way out of a maze,

        Away from gloom, in ways of art.
        The fox is proud, yet stands on guard;
        For when the moth anew in pain,
        He's here to comfort once again.
