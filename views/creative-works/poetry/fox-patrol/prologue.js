        Across the woods,
        Seemed small, but tough in heart,
        A lonely fox patrols a wooden cart.

        A cart of hopes and dreams of those
        Who never felt the touch of love
        A cart of faith and goals of those
        Who're lost in thought, who lost their path.

        Whose happiness got locked away,
        The key to locks hidden in hay,
        The fox, he hears the poor folks pray,
        The fox won't let their faith decay

        To those whose hopes patrolled by fox,
        Stay safe, stay strong, despite the locks,
        One day you'll feel the touch of love,
        You'll heal your wounds, and find your path.
