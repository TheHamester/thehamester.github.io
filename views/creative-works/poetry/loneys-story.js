        Loney's story is a series of poems about a deeply 
        depressed alien cat named Loney, who's deeply 
        influenced by his inner dialogue coming 
        from The Antenna on the top of his head, 
        keeping him in the loop of overthinking, 
        and eventually leading him to isolating himself into deep space.
