        Fox Patrol is a series of poems as a metaphor for my caring nature for all my friends whenever they feel in need of support, and serves as a big thank you to them for their support. 
        Unlike a lot of my other works, in the center of the series is not an anthropomorphic character. The whole series tends to have fable like vibe, where characters are more feral in nature with little to none human characteristics.
